 a print statement is 
 console.log()

 but how do you run the code? 
 python is built on

Java 
a much older language

javascript
kind of wanted to hop on the old popularity of java
they are very different

Script src = javascript source 

code usually runs top to bottom 

compile = putt everything together
JS is a compiled language
compiled languahe doesnt care about how its written
you dont need to worry about indentation, but it is impotant to use a semilcolon to show the end of the code



lists in JS = arrays 

dictionaries in JS = JS Object (JSON) 
Javascript Standard Notation
{ "" : [] }



JS HOISTING- brings something to the top
    console.log(random)
    random is not defined but still printed 
    the problem is that JS only tells you 'undefined' and isn't really a proper error message telling  you what went wrong


instead of using VAR, use LETT and CONST
    LET and CONST do not hoist
    cannot be Redeclared
    must be Declared before use.
    CONST value cannot be reassigned. use it until you have to use LET 
    have Block Scope.

    LET and CONST are both used as variable declarations 
    it is the newer ES6 Syntax
        Legacy code 
        Tech Debt 
            a lot of companies are working off of dev code from years ago, and might not be using up to date practices 

    


Get used to checking the functions / venacular / concatenations 




FUNCTIONS 
//regularly named function

function nameOfFunction(param1, param2){
    //code goes here
    
    return
};
     long as its in the two curly braces you are part of the function, regardless of indentation  


arrow function is the new 3S6 syntax way of creating functions 
format: 
     () => {}
     ( params go here ) => { this is the code block }
     const cubeMe = () => {};
